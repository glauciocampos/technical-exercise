# Introduction to the Problem

In this scenario, we encounter a **fictitious** web application named "Survey" facing availability issues in its current on-premises setup. The application comprises a frontend container running on a Linux machine and a separate Linux machine hosting the database. The client has opted to migrate their web app to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to address these challenges.

## Identified Challenges:

- Unsatisfactory availability in the current on-premises setup.
- Need for scalability to handle a large number of users.
- Complexity in managing and maintaining the on-premises infrastructure.
- Difficulties in ensuring high availability and resilience.

The client seeks an OCI solution to overcome these challenges, aiming for an efficient and effective migration.
